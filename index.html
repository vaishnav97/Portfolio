            <h2>üéì Learning to Code in Delhi</h2>
            <p><em>where coffee shops became classrooms</em></p>
            
            <p>NSUT (formerly NSIT) 2016-2020. Computer Engineering because it sounded important.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Spent more time in library than lectures ‚Äì not because I was studious, but because the internet was better</li>
                <li>First real project was a mess of spaghetti code and sleepless nights, but it worked. Sort of.</li>
                <li>Campus placements were intense ‚Äì while everyone memorized algorithms, I focused on understanding how systems actually work</li>
                <li>Key learning: working software beats perfect software every single time</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>üíª First Steps into Tech</h2>
            <p><em>when 'hello world' felt like magic</em></p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>First program was Python with print statements everywhere because I didn't know debuggers existed</li>
                <li>Early projects were over-engineered disasters ‚Äì solving simple problems with complex solutions</li>
                <li>Gradually learned that the best code is often the code you don't have to write</li>
                <li>Fell in love with backend systems during an internship ‚Äì databases, message queues, APIs fascinated me</li>
                <li>While everyone wanted to build pretty UIs, I was drawn to the invisible magic that makes everything possible</li>
            </ul>
